# Hooked on React

This is a companion repo to my Hooked on React presentation which can be found
[here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Hhs20BZf844ebt7yFC9aSor2gOWUS7WTUJxhT2DTRsE/edit?usp=sharing). The app
can be found [here](https://hooked-on-react.netlify.com/).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) using the typescript
template.

## Running the App

After installing packages with `npm i`, run the app locally with `npm start`.
